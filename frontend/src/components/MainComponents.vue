      Hey there! This is a nifty little project that's all about converting images in JPG, PNG,
      WEBP, and SVG formats. But that's not all! It also optimizes your images and resizes them.
      Pretty cool, huh?

      We've got a split front and server setup here, with all the chit-chat happening via API. You
      can find all the juicy details on GitHub. This project is built with VUE and Fastify, and
      here's the kicker - we don't keep your pics on our server. We process them in a buffer and
      send them straight back to you. We don't store your data, and we're as cuddly as a kitten.
      How's that for privacy?
